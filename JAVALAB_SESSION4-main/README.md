## Problem Statement
Create an abstract class `Account` and extend it with `SavingsAccount` and `CurrentAccount` to demonstrate polymorphism.

## Concepts Practiced
- Abstract classes  
- Method overriding  
- Dynamic dispatch  

## Files
- `Account.java` → Abstract base class  
- `SavingsAccount.java` → Subclass for savings account  
- `CurrentAccount.java` → Subclass for current account  
- `BankTest.java` → Main program to test polymorphism  

## Sample Output
--- Savings Account ---
Account Number: S1001
Balance: 4200.0
Interest Rate: 5.0%

--- Current Account ---
Account Number: C2001
Balance: -500.0
Overdraft Limit: 2000.0
